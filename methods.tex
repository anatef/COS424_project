\subsection{Feature Extraction}
In order to analyze the MovieLens dataset, we first extracted several features, for the movies and users seperately. 

\textbf{Movies basic features} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Genres binary vector representing all the genres included in the movie. Each movie follows the genre standard of IMDB (Internet Movie Database, www.imdb.com). Each movie belongs to a minimum of one genre and a maximum of five
\item Average rating by all users
\item Number of ratings
\item Ratings standard deviation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Users basic features} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Age
\item Gender
\item Number of ratings
\item Occupation
\item Average rating given by the user
\item Number of ratings
\item Ratings standard deviation
\end{itemize}

After the basic extraction of features, we further analyzed the existing features to create additional user features:

\textbf{Users genres preference}
To represent the user genre prefrence based on his past ratings, we created a score that captures the average rating of a user for each genre: 

\begin{equation} score\_for\_movie\_genre(G_j) = \frac{\sum^5_{i=1}{rating_i\times number\_of\_movie\_rating_i}}{Total\_number\_of\_movies} 
\end{equation}

\subsection{Feature selection}
The prediction will be based on the movies features included in those datasets: name, genre, and year. We will also try to extract additional movies features from other sources, such as IMDB. Another file in the dataset includes tags done by the users regarding the movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. We will check the option of using the tags as additional feature.
Additionally, we will conduct a literature survey to understand what features are relvant for our prediction aim.

\subsection{Ratings Prediction}
\textbf{Known prediction algorithms}
We found a relevant study of movie recommender systems deomnstrating the use of SVD for movie rating prediction~\cite{Ekstrand:2011:RRR:2043932.2043958}.
We will also try to predict users ratings of movies using several linear models and regression algorithms we saw in class:
\begin{itemize}
\item Support Vector Machine
\item K-Neareast Neighbours
\item Random Forest
\item Preceptron
\item Logistic Regression
\item Ridge
\item Lasso
\end{itemize}
We may try additional ones.

\textbf{Users similarity}
Another approach would be to predict by similarity to other users. For each of the inspected users, we will find the most similar users (e.g. using cosine similarity for ratings), and predict the best movies based on the preferences of the most similar users.

\textbf{Evaluation}
We will performe 10-fold cross-validation to asses our predictions, and calculate the average of the accumulated measurments from the 10 runs. We will report the average RMSE and R$^2$ as well as the probability density function of the prediction errors.
