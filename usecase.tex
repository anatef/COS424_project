\section{Use case: Movie night prediction}
After we have a general approach for predicting the rating for user-movie pairs, we want to find for a group of 3 users, one movie that maximizes their predicted ratings. This will be achieved by doing the following steps:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Find groups of 3 users with sufficient overlap of rated movies in our dataset
 \item Split these movies to training and test datasets
 \item Apply our prediction model on the training set and then predict for the test set
 \item Rank the movies according to the sum of predicted ratings and select the movie with the highest ratings sum
 \end{itemize}
