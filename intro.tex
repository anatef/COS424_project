% VOD
The Netflix revolution is alive and kicking. 
In the past few years, the number of American Netflix subscribers has been on a constant climb, while average movie revenues has been dropping~\cite{MisixNetflix}.
According to a recent study~\cite{VarietyNetflixBandwidth}, Netflix's Video-on-demand services account for roughly 36.5\% of overall internet bandwidth, and the bandwidth consumed by YouTube is 15.6\%; overall, more than half of the internet bandwidth is consumed by these two video streaming services.
These statistics emphasize the importance of Netflix and YouTube on the wide-ranging internet footprint, and therefore these service always seek to improve the viewer's experience.

% SOCIAL NETWORKS
Another emerging trend of recent years is social networks such as Facebook; around 72\% of all adults are using Facebook at least once a month, and 91\% of all millennials~\cite{FacebookStats}

In our project, \textit{SocialFlix}, we attempt to add a new social aspect to online Video-On-Demand services; assuming multiple users are in a social gathering, and they are all subscribed to the same VOD service, which movies should they see?
More specifically, we wish to maximize their viewing experiences and suggest them movies that they have not yet seen, but are likely to be well accepted.
For that we assume the service has a database that stores past movie ratings of these users, and attempt to rank the movies with the highest shared ratings by all users.
