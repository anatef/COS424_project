On-demand video services have become ubiquitous into practically a cultural phenomenon, and additionally, social networks have seem to alter the way people share experiences.
We present \textit{SocialFlix!}, a study that attempts to correlate the movie preferences of multiple VOD service users.
In our study, we tackle with the following problem:
assuming a person invites friends over for a night of movie watching (BYOP - Bring your own popcorn); based on their past movie preferences, which movies should the host choose? 
We define this problem as an attempt maximize the experience for all invited friends, which is done by obtaining the movies that are likely to achieve the highest rating for all friends, while never seen by any of them.
