On-demand video services have become ubiquitous in the scale of a cultural phenomenon, and the emergence of social networks have altered the way people share experiences. 
User experience is one of the main targets for VOD services, and crowdsourcing can aid in making them personalized services.
We present \textit{SocialFlix!}, a recommender system that for each user create a personal movie recommendation list, tailored to his preferences.
In our work, we explore several Collaborating Filtering algorithms that predict how unseen movies are likely to be accepted by users, and build recommendation lists based on these predictions. 

We show that by using cosine similarity for accurate rating prediction we achieve rating predictions with RMSE rates of 0.84. 
Using K-means clustering for user movie recommendation, we achieve a maximal NDCG@k score of 0.93.
Finally, using matrix factorization techniques for movie likeability prediction we achieve a maximal F1 score of 0.66, precision of 0.78, and ROC curve AUC of 0.72.
