On-demand video services have become ubiquitous in the scale of a cultural phenomenon, and the emergence of social networks have altered the way people share experiences. 
User exprience is one of the main targets for VOD services, and croudsourcing can aid in making them personalized services.
We present \textit{SocialFlix!}, a recommender system that for each user create a personal movie recommendation list, tailored to his preferences.
In our work, we explore several Collaborating filtering algorithms that predict the how unseen movies are likely to be accepcted by users, and build recommendation lists based on these predictions. 
We show that by using \hl{TODO: write methods} we achieve \hl{TODO: stats on prediction}
